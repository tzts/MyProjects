Below you can find a pdf file including  my thesis project.The project I worked on was the creation of  a NAS system 
using a Raspberry Pi 4 computer.Since I concluded  my studies in a greek university,my whole  thesis  is written in greek.
Inside  this  file  someone can find  the software i used to give life  to the Pi.Furthermore,there are quite obviously 
written the lines  of commands which I used for  the implementation of this project.Last but  not  least ,anyone  can see 
in many pictures the  results of all the hard work.
