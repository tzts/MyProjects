		The school has a fully integrated

		within and beyond the school. Access
		controls have been deployed to all

		ICT is used effectively to support
		management tasks. Appropriate
		access is readily available across the
		school and widely used by most staff
		to share data and resources. This has
		a clear impact across all management
		areas. Some access controls have

		</th>
		<th> <input type="radio" name="50" value="4"/>
		The school uses an assortment of ICT

		Access is only through the school
		office. ICT use is limited to isolated
		aspects of the schools management
		and much work is still done manually.
		There is no designated person in
		charge of backing up data. Data is
		not always backed up in a daily
		routine and it is sometimes difficult
		to recover data.
